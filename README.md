# Prediction & Geospatial Analysis of the World Happiness Report

# Motivation
The World Happiness Report lacks a presentation of the Hap-piness Scores per country on a world map. Plus, I was interest-ed in how Gross Domestic Pro-duct could predict Happiness Scores. 

# Data
Five data sets from the WHR 2015-2019, containing 155-158 entries of countries, their Hap-piness Scores, and six contribu-ting factors (GDP, life expectan-cy, generosity, social support, freedom and corruption).

# Steps 
* Consistency checks
* Data wrangling
* Explore relationships
* Create a choropleth map
* Conduct a Linear Regression
  
# Findings 
Gross Domestic Product was able to explain R² = 61,7% of the variance of the Happiness Score in the test set and R² = 62,5% in the training set (RMSE = 0,7 for both).
